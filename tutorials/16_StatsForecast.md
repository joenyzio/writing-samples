### Example 1: Basic Time Series Forecasting

We'll use the Air Passengers dataset for this example:

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import AutoARIMA
from statsforecast.utils import AirPassengersDF

# Load the dataset
df = AirPassengersDF

# Initialize StatsForecast with AutoARIMA model
sf = StatsForecast(
    models=[AutoARIMA(season_length=12)],
    freq='M'  # Monthly frequency
)

# Fit the model to the dataset
sf.fit(df)

# Make predictions for the next 12 months
forecasts = sf.predict(h=12)
print(forecasts)
```

In this example, you'll:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Initialize StatsForecast with an AutoARIMA model.
3. Fit the model to the data.
4. Generate forecasts for the next 12 months.


### Example 2: Advanced Forecasting with Multiple Models

Let's explore a more advanced scenario using multiple models and cross-validation:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    F[Example 2: Advanced Forecasting with Multiple Models]
    F --> G[Load Data]
    F --> H[Initialize with Multiple Models]
    F --> I[Fit Models]
    F --> J[Cross-Validation]
    F --> K[Select Best Model]
    F --> L[Generate Forecasts]
```


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import AutoARIMA, AutoETS, AutoTheta
import pandas as pd

# Load your data (replace 'your_data.csv' with your actual dataset)
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Initialize StatsForecast with multiple models
sf = StatsForecast(
    models=[
        AutoARIMA(season_length=12),  # AutoARIMA model with a season length of 12
        AutoETS(season_length=12),    # AutoETS model with a season length of 12
        AutoTheta(season_length=12)   # AutoTheta model with a season length of 12
    ],
    freq='M'  # Monthly frequency
)

# Fit the models to the dataset
sf.fit(df)

# Perform cross-validation with a horizon of 12 and a step size of 1
cv_results = sf.cross_validation(df, h=12, step_size=1)

# Select the best model based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
best_model = cv_results.groupby('model').mean()['MAPE'].idxmin()

# Make predictions using the best model, with prediction intervals at 80% and 95% confidence levels
forecasts = sf.predict(h=12, level=[80, 95])
