    ```sql
    CREATE ML_ENGINE openai_engine  -- Create a new AI engine named 'openai_engine'
    FROM openai  -- Specify the engine type as OpenAI
    USING
      api_key = 'your_openai_api_key';  -- Provide the OpenAI API key
    ```

2. **Create and Deploy an AI Model**:
    - Define the question-answering model using the AI engine and a prompt template.
    ```sql
    CREATE MODEL question_answering_model  -- Create a new model named 'question_answering_model'
    PREDICT answer  -- The model will predict the 'answer' field
    USING
      engine = 'openai_engine',  -- Use the 'openai_engine' configured earlier
      prompt_template = 'Answer the following question: {{question}}. Use the following context: {{article_title}}',  -- Define the prompt template
      model_name = 'gpt-3.5-turbo';  -- Specify the underlying model to use
    ```

3. **Query for Predictions**:
    - Query the model to get answers to questions.
    ```sql
    SELECT input.question, output.answer  -- Select the question and the corresponding predicted answer
    FROM mysql_demo_db.questions AS input  -- Source table containing questions
    JOIN question_answering_model AS output  -- Join with the model output to get predictions
    LIMIT 3;  -- Limit the results to 3
    ```

This example demonstrates how to configure an AI engine, create a question-answering model, and query for predictions using MindsDB.

### Example 2: Customer Churn Prediction

Let's create a more advanced model for predicting customer churn. Follow these steps:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create Churn Prediction Model] --> B[Query for Churn Predictions]
```

1. **Assume We Have a `customer_data` Table**:
    - This table is in our connected database and contains data relevant for predicting churn.

2. **Create the Churn Prediction Model**:
    - Use the `CREATE MODEL` statement to create a model for predicting churn.
    ```sql
    CREATE MODEL churn_predictor  -- Create a new model named 'churn_predictor'
    FROM mysql_demo_db  -- Specify the source database
      (SELECT * FROM customer_data)  -- Select all data from the 'customer_data' table
    PREDICT churn  -- The model will predict the 'churn' field
    USING
      engine = 'lightwood';  -- Use the 'lightwood' machine learning engine
    ```

3. **Query the Model for Predictions**:
    - Retrieve predictions from the `churn_predictor` model.
    ```sql
    SELECT 
      t.customer_id,  -- Select customer ID
      t.name,  -- Select customer name
      m.churn AS churn_prediction,  -- Get the predicted churn value
      m.churn_confidence  -- Get the confidence of the churn prediction
    FROM mysql_demo_db.customer_data AS t  -- Source table
    JOIN churn_predictor AS m  -- Join with the model predictions
    WHERE t.customer_id > 1000  -- Filter condition
    LIMIT 10;  -- Limit the results to 10
    ```

**Explanation**:

1. **Assume We Have a `customer_data` Table**:
    - Ensure your `customer_data` table is available in your connected database.

2. **Create the Churn Prediction Model**:
    - The `CREATE MODEL` statement defines a new model named `churn_predictor` using the `lightwood` ML engine.
    - The model uses data from the `customer_data` table to predict the `churn` field.

3. **Query the Model for Predictions**:
    - The `SELECT` statement retrieves predictions by joining the `customer_data` table with the `churn_predictor` model.
    - The query selects the customer ID, name, churn prediction, and prediction confidence, filtering for customer IDs greater than 1000 and limiting the results to 10.

By following these steps, you will have created a customer churn prediction model and retrieved predictions using MindsDB.
