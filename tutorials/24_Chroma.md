## Getting Started with Chroma

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Install Chroma] --> B[pip install chromadb]
    A --> C[pip install chromadb-client]
    B --> D[Chroma Client]
    C --> D[Chroma Client]
```

### Installation and Setup

Alright, let's dive in and get Chroma set up on your system. We'll walk through the installation and initial configuration steps together.

#### Installation

First things first, we need to install Chroma. You can do this using pip, the Python package installer. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install chromadb
```

If you only need the client version for a client-server setup, you can install it with:

```bash
pip install chromadb-client
```

### Initial Configuration

Now that we have Chroma installed, let's configure it to start using it. We'll go through creating a client, setting up a collection, adding documents, and querying the collection.

1. **Create a Chroma Client**

   Let's start by creating a Chroma client. This client will allow us to interact with Chroma.

   ```python
   import chromadb

   # Create a Chroma client instance
   client = chromadb.Client()
   ```

   If you want to use persistent storage, where your data is saved to disk rather than kept in memory, you can set up a persistent client like this:

   ```python
   # Create a persistent Chroma client instance
   client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="path/to/storage")
   ```

   In this setup, replace `"path/to/storage"` with the actual path where you want to store your data.

2. **Create a Collection**

   Next, we need to create a collection within Chroma. Think of a collection as a container where we store related documents.

   ```python
   # Create a collection named "my_collection"
   collection = client.create_collection("my_collection")
   ```

   Here, we're creating a collection called `"my_collection"`. You can name your collection whatever makes the most sense for your application.

3. **Add Documents**

   Now that we have a collection, let's add some documents to it. Each document can also have associated metadata and an ID.

   ```python
   # Add documents to the collection
   collection.add(
       documents=["This is a document", "This is another document"],
       metadatas=[{"source": "my_source"}, {"source": "my_source"}],
       ids=["id1", "id2"]
   )
   ```

   In this example:
   - We add two documents: `"This is a document"` and `"This is another document"`.
   - Each document has associated metadata, in this case, a `source` field.
   - Each document is given a unique ID: `"id1"` and `"id2"`.

4. **Query the Collection**

   Finally, let's query our collection to retrieve documents based on some search criteria.

   ```python
   # Query the collection
   results = collection.query(
       query_texts=["This is a query document"],
       n_results=2
   )
   ```

   In this query:
   - We're searching for documents related to the text `"This is a query document"`.
   - We want the top 2 results (`n_results=2`).

By following these steps, you've set up Chroma, created a collection, added documents, and performed a query. This is just the beginning, and there's a lot more you can do with Chroma. We'll dive deeper into its features and capabilities in the next sections.

## Practical Examples

Alright, now let's dive into some hands-on examples to get you comfortable with Chroma. We'll explore how to use custom embedding functions and how to filter query results based on metadata. 

### Example 1: Custom Embedding Functions

#### Task Description

In this example, we'll set up a custom embedding function using OpenAI. Custom embedding functions allow you to generate embeddings tailored to your specific needs.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up Custom Embedding Function**

   First, we need to import the necessary module and set up the embedding function using OpenAI.

   ```python
   from chromadb.utils import embedding_functions

   # Create an embedding function using OpenAI
   openai_ef = embedding_functions.OpenAIEmbeddingFunction(
       api_key="your-api-key",  # Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
       model_name="text-embedding-ada-002"  # Specify the model name
   )

   # Create a collection with the custom embedding function
   collection = client.create_collection("my_collection", embedding_function=openai_ef)
   ```

   In this code:
   - We import the `embedding_functions` module from Chroma.
   - We create an embedding function using OpenAI's API. Make sure to replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual API key.
   - We specify the model name, in this case, `"text-embedding-ada-002"`.
   - We create a collection called `"my_collection"` and assign the custom embedding function to it.

2. **Explanation of Results**

   By setting up a custom embedding function, Chroma can now use the specified OpenAI model to generate embeddings for the documents in your collection. This means that every time you add a document to `"my_collection"`, the custom embedding function will be used to generate its embedding, enabling more precise and tailored searches.

### Example 2: Metadata Filtering

#### Task Description

Next, we'll learn how to filter query results based on metadata. This is useful when you need to narrow down search results to documents that meet certain criteria.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up Metadata Filtering**

   Let's see how to perform a query with metadata filtering.

   ```python
   # Query the collection with metadata filtering
   results = collection.query(
       query_texts=["This is a query document"],  # The text to query
       where={"source": "my_source"},  # Filter results where the metadata 'source' is 'my_source'
       n_results=2  # Number of results to return
   )
   ```

   In this code:
   - We query the collection for documents related to the text `"This is a query document"`.
   - We add a filter to only include documents where the `source` metadata is `"my_source"`.
   - We specify that we want the top 2 results.

2. **Explanation of Results**

   The query results will be filtered based on the specified metadata, meaning that only documents with the metadata `source` equal to `"my_source"` will be included in the results. This allows you to refine your search and retrieve documents that meet specific criteria, making your search results more relevant and useful.

By following these steps, you'll be able to leverage Chroma's capabilities to create custom embedding functions and filter query results based on metadata. These features will help you manage and retrieve your data more efficiently and effectively. Keep practicing with different queries and configurations to become more proficient with Chroma!

## Advanced Usage

Alright, let's dive into some advanced features and configurations of Chroma. These will help you get the most out of your Chroma setup.

### Detailed Features

First, let's look at how to customize the distance function used for similarity searches. This can significantly impact the results depending on your use case.

1. **Changing Distance Function**:

   By default, Chroma uses the "l2" distance function. However, you can change this to "cosine" or "ip" depending on your needs. Let's see how to set this up.

   ```python
   # Create a collection with a custom distance function
   collection = client.create_collection(
       "my_collection",  # Name of the collection
       metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"}  # Setting the distance function to cosine
   )
   ```

   Here’s what’s happening:
   - We're creating a collection named "my_collection".
   - We're customizing the distance function to "cosine" by setting the metadata parameter `"hnsw:space": "cosine"`. You can also use "l2" (the default) or "ip" (inner product).

### Customization and Optimization

To get the best performance from Chroma, consider these customization and optimization techniques:

1. **Optimize Schema Design**:

   Tailoring your schema to fit your specific use case can improve performance. Think carefully about what properties you need and how you will query them. For example, if you frequently search by date, ensure your schema includes date fields that are indexed.

2. **Vector Compression**:

   Implementing vector compression can help reduce memory usage, especially with large datasets. This involves reducing the dimensionality of your vectors while maintaining their essential features. Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can be used for this purpose.

3. **Scaling Chroma**:

   Adjusting CPU, memory, and GPU resources is crucial for efficiently scaling your Chroma deployment. Monitor your resource usage and scale up as needed to handle increased loads. This can involve moving from a local setup to a more robust client-server architecture.
