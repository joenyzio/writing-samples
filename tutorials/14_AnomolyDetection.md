## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Basic Anomaly Detection with KNN

Let's kick things off with a straightforward example using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to detect anomalies. This example will walk you through generating sample data, fitting a KNN model, making predictions, and visualizing the results.

Here's the plan:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Generate Sample Data] --> B[Initialize and Fit KNN Detector]
    B --> C[Get Prediction Labels and Scores]
    C --> D[Visualize Results]
```

1. **Generate Sample Data**: We'll start by generating synthetic data with some known anomalies. This helps us understand how our model works in a controlled environment.

2. **Initialize and Fit KNN Detector**: We'll create a KNN detector and fit it to our data.

3. **Get Prediction Labels and Scores**: After fitting the model, we'll get the prediction labels and outlier scores.

4. **Visualize Results**: Finally, we'll plot the results to visualize which points are detected as anomalies.

Let's dive into the code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pyod.models.knn import KNN
from pyod.utils.data import generate_data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Generate sample data
X_train, y_train = generate_data(n_train=200, n_features=2, contamination=0.1, random_state=42)

# Step 2: Initialize and fit the KNN detector
clf = KNN()
clf.fit(X_train)

# Step 3: Get the prediction labels and outlier scores
y_train_pred = clf.labels_  # binary labels (0: inliers, 1: outliers)
y_train_scores = clf.decision_scores_  # raw outlier scores

# Step 4: Visualize the results
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(X_train[y_train == 0, 0], X_train[y_train == 0, 1], label='Normal', alpha=0.7)
plt.scatter(X_train[y_train == 1, 0], X_train[y_train == 1, 1], color='r', label='Anomaly', alpha=0.7)
plt.title("KNN Anomaly Detection")
plt.xlabel("Feature 1")
plt.ylabel("Feature 2")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Here's a breakdown of what we're doing in the code:

- **Step 1**: We generate synthetic data with 200 samples and 2 features. We introduce some contamination (10%) to create anomalies in our dataset.
- **Step 2**: We initialize the KNN detector from PyOD and fit it to our training data.
- **Step 3**: We obtain prediction labels (`0` for inliers and `1` for outliers) and outlier scores from the fitted model.
- **Step 4**: We visualize the results using a scatter plot. Normal data points are shown in one color, and anomalies are highlighted in red.

This example gives you a solid foundation in using KNN for anomaly detection. Next, you can try experimenting with different datasets and tweaking the model parameters to see how they affect the results. Happy detecting!

### Example 2: Real-world Scenario - Credit Card Fraud Detection

Now, let's dive into a practical application of anomaly detection: identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. We'll use a real-world dataset to illustrate how to load, preprocess, and apply anomaly detection techniques to detect potential fraud.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Load and Preprocess Data] --> B[Normalize Features]
    B --> C[Initialize and Fit KNN Detector]
    C --> D[Get Prediction Labels and Scores]
    D --> E[Evaluate Model Performance]
    E --> F[Visualize Results]
```

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**: We'll start by loading the credit card transactions dataset and preparing it for analysis.
2. **Normalize Features**: To improve the performance of the anomaly detection algorithm, we'll normalize the features.
3. **Initialize and Fit KNN Detector**: We'll use the KNN algorithm to fit our data.
4. **Get Prediction Labels and Scores**: After fitting the model, we'll obtain the prediction labels and outlier scores.
5. **Evaluate Model Performance**: We'll evaluate how well the model performs in detecting fraudulent transactions using classification metrics.
6. **Visualize Results**: Finally, we'll use t-SNE to visualize the high-dimensional data in two dimensions.

Let's get started with the code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pyod.models.knn import KNN
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

# Step 1: Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')

# Step 2: Prepare the data by dropping non-relevant columns and setting up features and labels
X = df.drop(['Time', 'Class'], axis=1)
y = df['Class']

# Step 3: Normalize the features for better performance of the anomaly detection algorithm
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Step 4: Initialize and fit the KNN detector
clf = KNN()
clf.fit(X_normalized)

# Step 5: Get the prediction labels and outlier scores
y_pred = clf.labels_
y_scores = clf.decision_scores_

# Evaluate the results using classification metrics
print(classification_report(y, y_pred))

# Step 6: Visualize the results using t-SNE for dimensionality reduction
X_tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42).fit_transform(X_normalized)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
scatter = plt.scatter(X_tsne[:, 0], X_tsne[:, 1], c=y_pred, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar(scatter)
plt.title("Credit Card Transactions - Anomaly Detection")
plt.show()
```

Here's a breakdown of what we're doing:

- **Step 1**: We load the credit card transactions dataset. This dataset includes features of transactions and a 'Class' column indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent.
- **Step 2**: We prepare our dataset by dropping irrelevant columns ('Time') and separating the features (X) from the labels (y).
- **Step 3**: We normalize the features using `StandardScaler` to ensure the algorithm performs optimally.
- **Step 4**: We initialize the KNN detector and fit it to our normalized data.
- **Step 5**: We obtain prediction labels (`0` for normal transactions and `1` for anomalies) and outlier scores from the model. We then evaluate the model's performance using `classification_report` from scikit-learn.
- **Step 6**: We use t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset to two dimensions for visualization. This helps us see how the model distinguishes between normal transactions and anomalies.

By following these steps, you can effectively use anomaly detection to identify fraudulent credit card transactions, gaining valuable insights and improving security measures. Now, it's your turn to apply these techniques to your own datasets and see the power of anomaly detection in action!
