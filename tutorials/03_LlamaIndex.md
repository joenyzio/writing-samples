## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Building a Simple Question-Answering System

Let's walk through creating a basic question-answering system using LlamaIndex. This system will load a set of documents, index them, and allow you to ask questions based on the content of those documents.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Load Documents] --> B[Create Index];
    B --> C[Create Query Engine];
    C --> D[Ask Question];
    D --> E[Receive Answer];
```

Here’s how we can do it step-by-step:

1. **Load Documents**: First, we need to load the documents from a specified directory.
2. **Create an Index**: Next, we'll create an index from these documents to facilitate efficient querying.
3. **Create a Query Engine**: We'll set up a query engine that will use the index to answer questions.
4. **Ask a Question**: Finally, we'll query the system with a question and get an answer.

```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

# Step 1: Load documents from a directory
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader('data').load_data()

# Step 2: Create an index from the documents
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Step 3: Create a query engine
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

# Step 4: Ask a question
response = query_engine.query("What are the key features of our product?")
print(response)
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Load Documents**:
    ```python
    documents = SimpleDirectoryReader('data').load_data()
    ```
    - This command loads all documents from the 'data' directory. The `SimpleDirectoryReader` reads and processes the documents, making them ready for indexing.

2. **Create an Index**:
    ```python
    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
    ```
    - We create an index from the loaded documents. This index is crucial for efficiently retrieving relevant information when a query is made.

3. **Create a Query Engine**:
    ```python
    query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
    ```
    - The query engine is created from the index. This engine will handle the queries and use the index to find the best possible answers.

4. **Ask a Question**:
    ```python
    response = query_engine.query("What are the key features of our product?")
    print(response)
    ```
    - Here, we ask the system a question about the key features of our product. The query engine processes this question, searches the index, and returns the most relevant answer.

This simple example demonstrates the power of LlamaIndex to quickly ingest documents and provide accurate answers to queries based on the indexed content. Ready to take it a step further? Let's dive into more advanced applications in the next example!

### Example 2: Creating a Multi-Source Knowledge Base

In this advanced example, we're going to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive knowledge base. This approach will allow us to leverage information from local documents and web pages to answer complex queries effectively.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Load Local Documents**: We'll start by loading documents from a local directory.
2. **Load Web Pages**: Next, we'll fetch data from specific web pages.
3. **Combine All Documents**: We'll merge the local documents and web pages into a single dataset.
4. **Parse Documents into Nodes**: This step involves parsing the documents into nodes, which are more manageable units of information.
5. **Create a Vector Store**: We'll use a FAISS vector store to efficiently handle high-dimensional data.
6. **Create an Index with Combined Data**: The index will be created using the combined dataset.
7. **Create a Query Engine**: We'll set up a query engine that uses the index to answer questions.
8. **Ask a Complex Question**: Finally, we'll query the system with a complex question and retrieve the answer.

```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.readers.web import SimpleWebPageReader
from llama_index.core.node_parser import SimpleNodeParser
from llama_index.core.storage.storage_context import StorageContext
from llama_index.vector_stores.faiss import FaissVectorStore

# Step 1: Load local documents
local_docs = SimpleDirectoryReader('company_reports').load_data()

# Step 2: Load web pages
web_pages = SimpleWebPageReader(html_to_text=True).load_data(
    ['https://www.company.com/about', 'https://www.company.com/products']
)

# Step 3: Combine all documents
all_docs = local_docs + web_pages

# Step 4: Parse documents into nodes
parser = SimpleNodeParser()
nodes = parser.get_nodes_from_documents(all_docs)

# Step 5: Create a FAISS vector store
vector_store = FaissVectorStore(dim=1536)  # Dimension depends on your embedding model
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)

# Step 6: Create an index with the combined data
index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)

# Step 7: Create a query engine
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

# Step 8: Ask a complex question
response = query_engine.query("Compare our product features with our main competitors")
print(response)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Load Local Documents**:
    ```python
    local_docs = SimpleDirectoryReader('company_reports').load_data()
    ```
    - This command loads documents from the 'company_reports' directory, preparing them for indexing.

2. **Load Web Pages**:
    ```python
    web_pages = SimpleWebPageReader(html_to_text=True).load_data(
        ['https://www.company.com/about', 'https://www.company.com/products']
    )
    ```
    - We load content from specified web pages, converting HTML to text for easier processing.

3. **Combine All Documents**:
    ```python
    all_docs = local_docs + web_pages
    ```
    - Here, we merge the local documents and web page data into a single dataset.

4. **Parse Documents into Nodes**:
    ```python
    parser = SimpleNodeParser()
    nodes = parser.get_nodes_from_documents(all_docs)
    ```
    - We parse the combined dataset into nodes, which are smaller, more manageable units of information.

5. **Create a FAISS Vector Store**:
    ```python
    vector_store = FaissVectorStore(dim=1536)  # Dimension depends on your embedding model
    storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)
    ```
    - We create a FAISS vector store for efficient handling of high-dimensional data. The dimension should match your embedding model's output.

6. **Create an Index with Combined Data**:
    ```python
    index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)
    ```
    - Using the parsed nodes and storage context, we create an index that will allow efficient data retrieval.

7. **Create a Query Engine**:
    ```python
    query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
    ```
    - The query engine is set up from the index, enabling us to perform queries on the indexed data.

8. **Ask a Complex Question**:
    ```python
    response = query_engine.query("Compare our product features with our main competitors")
    print(response)
    ```
    - We query the system with a complex question, and the query engine processes this to provide a comprehensive answer based on the combined data sources.

This example showcases how LlamaIndex can integrate multiple data sources, use advanced indexing techniques, and provide detailed responses to complex queries, making it a powerful tool for creating comprehensive knowledge bases.
