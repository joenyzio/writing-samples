## Practical Examples

Now that we have everything set up, let's look at some practical examples to see Great Expectations in action.

### Example 1: Basic Data Validation

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Example 1: Basic Data Validation] --> B[Create Expectation Suite]
    A --> C[Create Batch of Data]
    A --> D[Validate Data]
```

Let's dive into our first example, where we will perform basic data validation on a simple dataset.

1. **Create Expectation Suite**: The first step is to create an expectation suite. Think of this suite as a collection of rules or "expectations" that you want your data to meet.
   ```bash
   great_expectations suite new
   ```
   When you run this command, Great Expectations will prompt you to name your suite and guide you through the process of setting up your initial expectations.

2. **Create Batch of Data**: Next, we need to load a batch of data that we want to validate. This is where we specify the data source and the specific dataset we are working with.
   ```python
   from great_expectations.data_context import DataContext
   
   # Initialize the Data Context
   context = DataContext()
   
   # Define batch kwargs (replace with your specific parameters)
   batch_kwargs = {
       "datasource": "my_datasource",
       "path": "path/to/your/data.csv"
   }
   
   # Load the batch
   batch = context.get_batch(batch_kwargs, suite_name="my_suite")
   ```
   Here, we're initializing our data context, which serves as the main entry point for all Great Expectations operations. We then define our batch parameters, specifying the datasource and the path to our dataset. Finally, we load the batch using these parameters.

3. **Validate Data**: Now it's time to validate our data against the expectations we've defined. This step runs the data through our expectation suite and checks if the data meets the specified criteria.
   ```python
   results = context.run_validation_operator(
       "action_list_operator", 
       assets_to_validate=[batch]
   )
   ```
   The `run_validation_operator` method executes the validation process. Here, "action_list_operator" is a predefined operator that runs the validation and performs a series of actions based on the results. We pass in our batch as the data to be validated. The results will show whether the data meets the expectations or if there are any discrepancies.

### Example 2: Advanced Data Validation with Checkpoints

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Example 2: Advanced Data Validation with Checkpoints] --> B[Create Checkpoint]
    A --> C[Run Checkpoint]
```

For our second example, we'll move on to more advanced data validation using checkpoints. Checkpoints provide a way to configure and run validation workflows.

1. **Create Checkpoint**: First, we need to set up a checkpoint. A checkpoint is essentially a predefined validation workflow that you can run at any time.
   ```bash
   great_expectations checkpoint new my_checkpoint
   ```
   Running this command will prompt you to create a new checkpoint. You'll specify details such as the name of the checkpoint and the expectation suite it should use.

2. **Run Checkpoint**: Once the checkpoint is created, we can execute it to validate our data. This is useful for automating regular data validation tasks.
   ```bash
   great_expectations checkpoint run my_checkpoint
   ```
   Here, we simply run the checkpoint by its name. The checkpoint will use the configurations we defined earlier to validate the specified dataset against the expectations.

By following these steps and examples, you'll be well on your way to ensuring data quality with Great Expectations. Whether you're just starting out or diving into advanced features, these practices will help you maintain high standards and trust in your data. Let's get started and explore the powerful capabilities of Great Expectations!

### Example 1: Basic Data Validation

Let's validate a simple CSV file step-by-step.

1. **Create an Expectation Suite**:
   ```bash
   great_expectations suite new
   ```
   Run this command to start the process of creating an expectation suite. You will be prompted to provide a name for the suite and then you can define the initial set of expectations for your data.

2. **Create a Batch of Data**:
   ```python
   import great_expectations as gx
   from great_expectations.core.batch import BatchRequest

   # Initialize a Data Context
   context = gx.get_context()
   
   # Define a Batch Request
   batch_request = BatchRequest(
       datasource_name="my_datasource",
       data_connector_name="default_inferred_data_connector_name",
       data_asset_name="my_data.csv",
   )
   ```
   Here, we are initializing the data context, which is the central object in Great Expectations for managing your data validation workflow. We then define a `BatchRequest`, which specifies the data source and data asset we are working with. This tells Great Expectations where to find the data and what data to load.

3. **Validate the Data**:
   ```python
   # Get a Validator for the batch of data
   validator = context.get_validator(batch_request=batch_request, expectation_suite_name="my_suite")
   
   # Add an expectation to ensure no null values in a specified column
   validator.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null(column="column_name")
   
   # Validate the data against the expectation suite
   results = validator.validate()
   print(results)
   ```
   In this step, we obtain a validator object for our batch of data. We add an expectation to ensure there are no null values in a specific column. Finally, we validate the data against the expectation suite and print the results. This will show whether the data meets the expectation or if there are any issues.

### Example 2: Advanced Data Validation with Checkpoints

1. **Create a Checkpoint**:
   ```bash
   great_expectations checkpoint new
   ```
   Follow the prompts to create a new checkpoint. This involves specifying details such as the name of the checkpoint and the expectation suite it will use. Checkpoints help automate and manage your data validation workflows more efficiently.

2. **Run the Checkpoint**:
   ```python
   # Define the batch request again if not already defined
   batch_request = BatchRequest(
       datasource_name="my_datasource",
       data_connector_name="default_inferred_data_connector_name",
       data_asset_name="my_data.csv",
   )
   
   # Run the checkpoint
   checkpoint_result = context.run_checkpoint(
       checkpoint_name="my_checkpoint",
       batch_request=batch_request,
   )
   print(checkpoint_result)
   ```
   Here, we define the batch request again if it hasn’t been defined previously. Then, we run the checkpoint using the `run_checkpoint` method, passing in the name of the checkpoint and the batch request. The results will indicate whether the data meets the expectations defined in the checkpoint.

In these examples, we've demonstrated how to set up basic and advanced data validation using Great Expectations. By creating expectation suites and checkpoints, you can ensure the quality and integrity of your data consistently and efficiently. Let’s start applying these practices to your own datasets and see the impact of maintaining high data quality standards!
