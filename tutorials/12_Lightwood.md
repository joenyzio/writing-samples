## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Predicting House Prices

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Load Dataset] --> B[Define Prediction Task]
    B --> C[Generate and Train Model]
    C --> D[Make Predictions]
```

Let's dive into a practical example of using Lightwood to predict house prices. Follow these steps:

1. **Load Dataset**:
    - First, we'll load a dataset containing information about house rentals.
    - We'll use Pandas to read the dataset from a CSV file.

2. **Define Prediction Task**:
    - We'll define the problem by specifying which column we want to predict (the target variable).
    - We'll also set a time aim for training the model to optimize the process.

3. **Generate and Train Model**:
    - Lightwood will generate the necessary JSON-AI code based on the problem definition and dataset.
    - We'll convert this JSON-AI into Python code and use it to create and train the predictor.

4. **Make Predictions**:
    - Finally, we'll use the trained predictor to make predictions on a subset of the data.

Here's the complete code to achieve this:

```python
import pandas as pd
from lightwood.api.high_level import ProblemDefinition, json_ai_from_problem, code_from_json_ai, predictor_from_code

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/benchmarks/main/benchmarks/datasets/home_rentals/data.csv")

# Define the prediction task
pdef = ProblemDefinition.from_dict({
    "target": "rental_price",  # Specify the target variable
    "time_aim": 20  # Set the time aim for model training
})

# Generate JSON-AI code based on the problem definition and dataset
json_ai = json_ai_from_problem(df, problem_definition=pdef)

# Convert JSON-AI to Python code
code = code_from_json_ai(json_ai)

# Create and train the predictor
predictor = predictor_from_code(code)
predictor.learn(df)

# Make predictions on a subset of the data
predictions = predictor.predict(df.iloc[:10])
print(predictions)  # Print the predictions
```

**Explanation**:
- **Loading the Dataset**: We use `pd.read_csv` to load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Defining the Prediction Task**: `ProblemDefinition.from_dict` helps us set the target variable and time aim for the model training.
- **Generating and Training the Model**: Lightwood's high-level API functions (`json_ai_from_problem`, `code_from_json_ai`, `predictor_from_code`) streamline the process of generating JSON-AI code, converting it to Python, and creating a predictor.
- **Making Predictions**: After training, the predictor can be used to make predictions on new data. Here, we predict rental prices for the first 10 rows of the dataset and print the results.

This example showcases how Lightwood simplifies the machine learning workflow, enabling you to quickly move from data ingestion to making predictions with minimal effort.

### Example 2: Customer Churn Prediction

Now let's take a more advanced example and use Lightwood to predict customer churn. This will help businesses identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling proactive measures to retain them. Follow these steps:

1. **Load Customer Data**:
    - We will load a dataset that contains customer information, including whether they have churned or not.

2. **Define Prediction Task**:
    - We'll define the target variable for churn prediction and set a training time aim.

3. **Generate and Train Model**:
    - Lightwood will generate JSON-AI code based on our problem definition and dataset.
    - We'll convert this JSON-AI into Python code and use it to create and train the predictor.

4. **Make Predictions on New Data**:
    - After training, we'll use the predictor to make churn predictions on new customer data.

Here's the complete code to achieve this:

```python
import pandas as pd
from lightwood.api.high_level import ProblemDefinition, json_ai_from_problem, code_from_json_ai, predictor_from_code

# Load customer data
df = pd.read_csv("customer_data.csv")

# Define the prediction task
pdef = ProblemDefinition.from_dict({
    "target": "churn",  # Specify the target variable for churn prediction
    "time_aim": 30  # Set the time aim for model training
})

# Generate JSON-AI code based on the problem definition and dataset
json_ai = json_ai_from_problem(df, problem_definition=pdef)

# Convert JSON-AI to Python code
code = code_from_json_ai(json_ai)

# Create and train the predictor
predictor = predictor_from_code(code)
predictor.learn(df)

# Make predictions on new customer data
new_customers = pd.read_csv("new_customers.csv")
churn_predictions = predictor.predict(new_customers)
print(churn_predictions)  # Print the churn predictions
```

**Explanation**:
- **Loading the Customer Data**: We use `pd.read_csv` to load both the historical customer data and the new customer data into Pandas DataFrames.
- **Defining the Prediction Task**: We specify "churn" as the target variable in the problem definition and set a time aim of 30 seconds for model training.
- **Generating and Training the Model**: Lightwood’s high-level API functions (`json_ai_from_problem`, `code_from_json_ai`, `predictor_from_code`) streamline the creation of the JSON-AI code, conversion to Python code, and training of the predictor.
- **Making Predictions on New Data**: After training, the predictor is used to make churn predictions on the new customer data, which are then printed out.

This example demonstrates how Lightwood can be applied to a crucial business problem like customer churn prediction, helping companies take proactive steps to retain their customers. By following these steps, you can leverage Lightwood to quickly build and deploy machine learning models tailored to your specific business needs.
