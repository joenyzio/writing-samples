### Example 2: Model Composition

Now, let's create a more complex application that combines multiple models. We’ll build a system where we first translate a text and then summarize the translated text. 

1. **Define and deploy the Translator and Summarizer classes**:
    - **Explanation**: We’ll start by creating two classes, `Translator` and `Summarizer`. Each class will handle a specific task: translating text from English to French and summarizing text, respectively.
    - **Python Code**:
    ```python
    @serve.deployment
    class Translator:
        def __init__(self):
            # Load the translation model
            self.model = pipeline("translation_en_to_fr", model="t5-small")
        
        def translate(self, text):
            # Translate the text from English to French
            return self.model(text)[0]["translation_text"]

    @serve.deployment
    class Summarizer:
        def __init__(self):
            # Load the summarization model
            self.model = pipeline("summarization", model="t5-small")
        
        def summarize(self, text):
            # Summarize the text
            return self.model(text)[0]["summary_text"]
    ```

2. **Define the TextProcessor class that combines both models**:
    - **Explanation**: Next, we’ll create the `TextProcessor` class that uses both `Translator` and `Summarizer` to first summarize the text and then translate the summary.
    - **Python Code**:
    ```python
    @serve.deployment
    class TextProcessor:
        def __init__(self, translator, summarizer):
            # Initialize the Translator and Summarizer deployments
            self.translator = translator
            self.summarizer = summarizer
        
        async def __call__(self, request):
            # Get the text from the request
            text = await request.json()
            # Summarize the text using Summarizer
            summary = await self.summarizer.summarize.remote(text)
            # Translate the summary using Translator
            translation = await self.translator.translate.remote(summary)
            return {"summary": summary, "translation": translation}

    # Bind the Translator and Summarizer deployments to the TextProcessor
    translator = Translator.bind()
    summarizer = Summarizer.bind()
    text_processor = TextProcessor.bind(translator, summarizer)

    # Run the TextProcessor deployment
    serve.run(text_processor)
    ```

3. **Test the TextProcessor deployment**:
    - **Explanation**: Finally, we test our `TextProcessor` deployment by sending a POST request and printing the results.
    - **Python Code**:
    ```python
    import requests

    # Send a POST request to the deployed TextProcessor
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/TextProcessor", 
                             json="Ray Serve is a scalable model serving library...")
    # Print the response
    print(response.json())
    ```

**Explanation Recap**:
- **Model Deployment**: We defined two separate deployments for translation and summarization models. The `Translator` class translates text from English to French, while the `Summarizer` class summarizes the text.
- **Model Composition**: The `TextProcessor` class combines these two models, summarizing the input text first and then translating the summary.
- **Testing**: We send a test request to the combined deployment and print the results to see the summarized and translated text.

By following these steps, you've learned how to deploy individual models and compose them into a more complex pipeline using Ray Serve. This approach allows you to build scalable and efficient model serving solutions that can handle intricate workflows.
