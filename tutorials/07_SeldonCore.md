## Getting Started with Seldon Core

### Installation and Setup

Let's get Seldon Core up and running. Follow these steps to install and set up Seldon Core:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Install Kubernetes, Helm, Kustomize] --> B[Create namespace]
    B --> C[Install Seldon Core with Helm]
    C --> D[Verify installation]
```

1. **Prerequisites**:
   Before we start, make sure you have the following tools installed:
   - Kubernetes cluster (version >= 1.23)
   - Helm (version >= 3.0)
   - Kustomize (version >= 0.1.0)
   - Ingress controller (Istio >= 1.16 or Ambassador v1/v2)

2. **Create a Namespace**:
   We need to create a namespace for Seldon Core. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace seldon-system
   ```
   This command creates a new namespace called `seldon-system` where Seldon Core components will be deployed.

3. **Install Seldon Core with Helm**:
   Next, we’ll use Helm to install Seldon Core. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   helm install seldon-core seldon-core-operator \
   --repo https://storage.googleapis.com/seldon-charts \
   --set usageMetrics.enabled=true \
   --set istio.enabled=true \
   --namespace seldon-system
   ```
   This command installs Seldon Core in the `seldon-system` namespace with usage metrics and Istio enabled.

### Initial Configuration

After installing Seldon Core, let’s configure it for first-time use:

1. **Verify Installation**:
   To ensure everything is set up correctly, check the status of the Seldon Core components by running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n seldon-system
   ```
   You should see a list of pods in the `seldon-system` namespace. Look for the `seldon-controller-manager` pod. If it’s running, your installation was successful.

2. **Set Up Ingress**:
   To handle incoming traffic, we need to set up an Istio gateway for Seldon Core. Apply the following configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - << END
   apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: seldon-gateway
     namespace: istio-system
   spec:
     selector:
       istio: ingressgateway
     servers:
     - port:
         number: 80
         name: http
         protocol: HTTP
       hosts:
       - "*"
   END
   ```
   Let’s break this down:
   - `kubectl apply -f -`: This command applies the configuration provided via standard input (stdin).
   - `apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3`: Specifies the API version for Istio networking resources.
   - `kind: Gateway`: Defines a Gateway resource to manage inbound traffic.
   - `metadata`: Includes the `name` of the gateway and the `namespace` where it's deployed.
   - `spec`: The specification of the gateway:
     - `selector`: Selects the ingress gateway controller.
     - `servers`: Configures the server, specifying the port (80) and protocol (HTTP).
     - `hosts`: Specifies that the gateway should accept traffic for all hosts (`*`).

By following these steps, you'll have Seldon Core installed and configured with an ingress setup to handle incoming traffic for your deployed models. Now you’re ready to start deploying your machine learning models on Kubernetes using Seldon Core!

## Practical Examples

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Serialize the model] --> B[Create deployment configuration]
    B --> C[Deploy the model]
    C --> D[Model deployment successful]
```

1. **Serialize the Model**:
   First, we'll train a model and save it to a file.

   ```python
   # Import necessary libraries
   from sklearn import datasets
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   import joblib

   # Load the Iris dataset
   iris = datasets.load_iris()
   X, y = iris.data, iris.target

   # Initialize and train the RandomForestClassifier
   clf = RandomForestClassifier()
   clf.fit(X, y)

   # Save the trained model to a file named 'model.joblib'
   joblib.dump(clf, 'model.joblib')
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `from sklearn import datasets`: Import the dataset module from Scikit-learn.
   - `from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier`: Import the RandomForestClassifier.
   - `iris = datasets.load_iris()`: Load the Iris dataset.
   - `clf.fit(X, y)`: Train the classifier with the dataset.
   - `joblib.dump(clf, 'model.joblib')`: Save the trained model to a file.

2. **Create Deployment Configuration**:
   Next, create a YAML configuration file to define the deployment of the serialized model. Save the following YAML configuration as `sklearn-deployment.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: machinelearning.seldon.io/v1  # API version for SeldonDeployment
   kind: SeldonDeployment                    # Type of Kubernetes resource
   metadata:
     name: sklearn-deployment                # Name of the SeldonDeployment
   spec:
     predictors:
     - graph:
         children: []                        # No child nodes
         implementation: SKLEARN_SERVER      # Use the SKLEARN_SERVER implementation
         modelUri: gs://your-bucket/model.joblib  # URI where the model is stored
         name: classifier                    # Name of the model
       name: default                         # Default predictor
       replicas: 1                           # Number of replicas
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `apiVersion: machinelearning.seldon.io/v1`: Specifies the API version.

     - `graph`: Describes the model graph.
     - `implementation: SKLEARN_SERVER`: Specifies that we are using a Scikit-learn model server.
     - `modelUri`: The URI where the model is stored. Replace `gs://your-bucket/model.joblib` with your actual model URI.
     - `name: classifier`: The name of the model.
     - `replicas: 1`: Specifies the number of replicas.

3. **Deploy the Model**:
   Finally, apply the YAML configuration to deploy the model to the Kubernetes cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f sklearn-deployment.yaml
   ```

    B --> C[Deploy the model]
    C --> D[Model deployment successful]
```

1. **Serialize the Model**:
   First, we will train a TensorFlow model and save it to a directory.

   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf

   # Define a simple Sequential model
   model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
       tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),  # Hidden layer with 128 units
       tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Output layer with 10 units
   ])

   # Compile the model with an optimizer and loss function
   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

   # Save the model to a directory named 'model'
   model.save('model')
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `tf.keras.models.Sequential`: Defines a Sequential model in TensorFlow.

   - `model.save('model')`: Saves the model to a directory named 'model'.

2. **Create Deployment Configuration**:
   Next, create a YAML configuration file to define the deployment of the serialized TensorFlow model. Save the following YAML configuration as `tensorflow-deployment.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: machinelearning.seldon.io/v1  # API version for SeldonDeployment
   kind: SeldonDeployment                    # Type of Kubernetes resource
   metadata:

         modelUri: gs://your-bucket/model    # URI where the model is stored
         name: classifier                    # Name of the model
       name: default                         # Default predictor
       replicas: 1                           # Number of replicas
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `apiVersion: machinelearning.seldon.io/v1`: Specifies the API version for SeldonDeployment.
   - `kind: SeldonDeployment`: Defines the resource type as SeldonDeployment.
   - `metadata`: Contains metadata like the name of the deployment.
   - `spec`: Specifies the deployment details.
     - `predictors`: Defines the model predictors.
     - `graph`: Describes the model graph.
     - `implementation: TENSORFLOW_SERVER`: Specifies the use of TensorFlow server for model deployment.
     - `modelUri: gs://your-bucket/model`: The URI where the TensorFlow model is stored. Replace `gs://your-bucket/model` with your actual model URI.
     - `name: classifier`: The name of the model.
     - `replicas: 1`: Number of replicas to deploy.

3. **Deploy the Model**:
   Finally, apply the YAML configuration to deploy the TensorFlow model to the Kubernetes cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f tensorflow-deployment.yaml
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `kubectl apply -f tensorflow-deployment.yaml`: This command applies the configuration file to deploy the TensorFlow model on Kubernetes.
