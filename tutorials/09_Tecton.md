## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Basic Use Case

**Objective**: Create and serve a simple feature for transaction aggregation.

Let's walk through the process of defining, generating, and deploying a feature in Tecton.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Define the Feature] --> B[Generate Training Data]
    B --> C[Deploy the Feature]
```

1. **Define the Feature**:
    First, we need to create a feature view in Tecton that aggregates transaction amounts over a 30-minute window. This involves writing a Python function decorated with `@stream_feature_view`.

    ```python
    from tecton import stream_feature_view, Aggregate, td

    # Define a stream feature view that processes transaction data
    @stream_feature_view(
        source=transactions,  # Source dataset
        entities=[user],  # Entity for which the features are being calculated
        online=True,  # Enable online storage for real-time use
        offline=True,  # Enable offline storage for historical data
        features=[Aggregate("amount", "mean", td(minutes=30))]  # Calculate the mean transaction amount over 30 minutes
    )
    def stream_features(transactions):
        # Return relevant columns
        return transactions[["user_id", "timestamp", "amount"]]
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - `source=transactions`: Specifies the dataset containing transaction data.
    - `entities=[user]`: Defines the entity (e.g., user) for which the features are calculated.
    - `online=True`: Enables real-time storage of features.
    - `offline=True`: Enables historical storage of features.
    - `features=[Aggregate("amount", "mean", td(minutes=30))]`: Defines the feature to calculate the mean transaction amount over a 30-minute window.

2. **Generate Training Data**:
    Next, we generate the training data using the defined feature view.

    ```python
    # Generate training data for machine learning models
    training_data = stream_features.get_features_for_events(training_events)
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - `stream_features.get_features_for_events(training_events)`: Generates training data based on the defined feature view and the provided training events.

3. **Deploy the Feature**:
    Finally, we deploy the feature to Tecton's feature store.

    ```bash
    # Deploy the feature to Tecton's feature store
    tecton apply
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - `tecton apply`: Applies the configuration and deploys the defined features to the feature store.

By following these steps, you have successfully created, generated, and deployed a feature for transaction aggregation using Tecton. This feature can now be used in real-time and batch machine learning workflows, ensuring consistent and reliable data for your models.

### Example 2: Advanced Application

**Objective**: Implement a real-time fraud detection feature.

Let's dive into the process of creating and deploying a real-time feature to detect fraudulent transactions.

1. **Define the Real-Time Feature**:
    First, we'll create a feature view that sums transaction amounts over a 5-minute window, which can be useful for detecting unusual transaction patterns indicative of fraud.

    ```python
    from tecton import stream_feature_view, Aggregate, td

    # Define a stream feature view for real-time fraud detection
    @stream_feature_view(
        source=transactions,  # Source dataset
        entities=[user],  # Entity for which the features are being calculated
        online=True,  # Enable online storage for real-time use
        offline=True,  # Enable offline storage for historical data
        features=[Aggregate("amount", "sum", td(minutes=5))]  # Calculate the sum of transaction amounts over 5 minutes
    )
    def real_time_fraud_detection(transactions):
        # Return relevant columns
        return transactions[["user_id", "timestamp", "amount"]]
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - `source=transactions`: Specifies the dataset containing transaction data.
    - `entities=[user]`: Defines the entity (e.g., user) for which the features are calculated.
    - `online=True`: Enables real-time storage of features.
    - `offline=True`: Enables historical storage of features.
    - `features=[Aggregate("amount", "sum", td(minutes=5))]`: Defines the feature to calculate the sum of transaction amounts over a 5-minute window.

2. **Deploy and Serve the Feature**:
    Next, we deploy this real-time fraud detection feature to Tecton's feature store.

    ```bash
    # Deploy the real-time fraud detection feature to Tecton's feature store
    tecton apply
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - `tecton apply`: Applies the configuration and deploys the defined features to the feature store.

3. **Integrate with ML Model**:
    Finally, we integrate the deployed feature with a machine learning model to detect fraud. 

    ```python
    # Fetch real-time fraud detection features for fraud events
    fraud_features = real_time_fraud_detection.get_features_for_events(fraud_events)
    
    # Use the features to make predictions with the fraud detection model
    model.predict(fraud_features)
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - `real_time_fraud_detection.get_features_for_events(fraud_events)`: Fetches the real-time features for the provided fraud events.
    - `model.predict(fraud_features)`: Uses the fetched features to make predictions with the fraud detection model.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement a real-time fraud detection feature using Tecton, seamlessly integrating it with your existing machine learning model to enhance your fraud detection capabilities. This setup ensures that your models are equipped with up-to-date and relevant features, enabling more accurate and timely predictions.
