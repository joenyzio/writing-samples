## Getting Started with NeuralForecast

### Installation and Setup

Let's walk through the steps to get NeuralForecast up and running. You can install it using either pip or conda:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Install NeuralForecast] --> B[Prepare Dataset]
    B --> C[Import Necessary Modules]
```

To install NeuralForecast via pip, use the following command:

```bash
pip install neuralforecast
```

Alternatively, if you prefer using conda, you can install it with:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge neuralforecast
```

If you're interested in development or contributing to the library, you might want to clone the repository and install it in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast.git
cd neuralforecast
pip install -e .
```

### Initial Configuration

Once you have NeuralForecast installed, the next step is to import the necessary modules and prepare your dataset. Your dataset should be in a pandas DataFrame with the columns `unique_id`, `ds` (timestamp), and `y` (target variable).

Here's how you can set it up:

```python
import pandas as pd
from neuralforecast import NeuralForecast
from neuralforecast.models import NBEATS

# Create an example dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'unique_id': ['A'] * 10,  # Unique identifier for the time series
    'ds': pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', periods=10, freq='D'),  # Timestamps
    'y': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # Target variable
})

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a simple dataset and prepare it for use with NeuralForecast. The `unique_id` column represents the identifier for the time series, `ds` holds the dates, and `y` contains the values you want to forecast.

With your environment set up and data prepared, you're now ready to dive into using NeuralForecast to create powerful forecasting models!

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Basic Use Case

Let's dive into a simple example where we use the N-BEATS model to forecast future values. This will give you a hands-on understanding of how to set up and use NeuralForecast for your time series forecasting needs.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Import the Necessary Libraries**: Start by importing the required libraries and modules.
2. **Create a Sample Dataset**: For demonstration purposes, we'll create a simple dataset.
3. **Initialize the N-BEATS Model**: Set up the N-BEATS model with specific parameters.
4. **Create a NeuralForecast Instance**: Use the N-BEATS model within a NeuralForecast instance.
5. **Fit the Model**: Train the model using the provided dataset.
6. **Make Predictions**: Forecast future values and print the predictions.

Let's see this in action:

```python
# Step 1: Import the necessary libraries
from neuralforecast import NeuralForecast
from neuralforecast.models import NBEATS
import pandas as pd

# Step 2: Create a sample dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'unique_id': ['A'] * 10,  # Unique identifier for the time series
    'ds': pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', periods=10, freq='D'),  # Timestamps
    'y': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # Target variable
})

# Step 3: Initialize the N-BEATS model
model = NBEATS(input_size=7, h=3, max_steps=100)  # input_size is the lookback period, h is the forecast horizon

# Step 4: Create a NeuralForecast instance with the N-BEATS model
nf = NeuralForecast(models=[model], freq='D')  # freq='D' indicates daily data

# Step 5: Fit the model to the dataset
nf.fit(df=data)

# Step 6: Predict future values
predictions = nf.predict()
print(predictions)
```

### Explanation

- **Data Preparation**: We create a DataFrame with `unique_id` representing the time series identifier, `ds` for the dates, and `y` for the values we want to forecast.
- **Model Initialization**: We initialize the N-BEATS model, specifying parameters like `input_size` (number of past observations to consider) and `h` (forecast horizon).
- **NeuralForecast Instance**: We create an instance of NeuralForecast, passing our model and specifying the frequency of the data.
- **Model Fitting**: We fit the model to our dataset using the `fit` method.
- **Making Predictions**: Finally, we use the `predict` method to forecast future values and print the results.

This example illustrates the simplicity and power of NeuralForecast in setting up and running neural network-based time series forecasting models. Feel free to experiment with different parameters and models to see how they affect the forecasts!

### Example 2: Advanced Application

In this example, we'll step up the complexity by using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model, which allows us to include exogenous variables in our forecasting. This is useful when external factors (like promotions, weather, or economic indicators) can influence the forecast.

Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing this:

1. **Import Libraries and Prepare Data**: Start by importing the necessary libraries and creating a dataset that includes an exogenous variable.

2. **Initialize the TFT Model**: Set up the TFT model with parameters that account for exogenous variables.

3. **Create a NeuralForecast Instance**: Use the TFT model within a NeuralForecast instance.

4. **Fit the Model**: Train the model using the provided dataset.

5. **Make Predictions**: Forecast future values and print the predictions.

Let's see this in action:

```python
# Step 1: Import Libraries and Prepare Data
from neuralforecast import NeuralForecast
from neuralforecast.models import TFT
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset with exogenous variables
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'unique_id': ['A'] * 10,  # Unique identifier for the time series
    'ds': pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', periods=10, freq='D'),  # Timestamps
    'y': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],  # Target variable
    'exog': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]  # Exogenous variable
})

# Step 2: Initialize the TFT Model
model = TFT(input_size=7, h=3, max_steps=100, futr_exog_list=['exog'])  # Include exogenous variables

# Step 3: Create a NeuralForecast Instance with the TFT Model
nf = NeuralForecast(models=[model], freq='D')  # freq='D' indicates daily data

# Step 4: Fit the Model to the Dataset
nf.fit(df=data)

# Step 5: Predict Future Values
predictions = nf.predict()
print(predictions)
```

### Comments and Explanation

1. **Import Libraries and Prepare Data**:
   - We import necessary modules from `neuralforecast` and `pandas`.
   - The dataset includes columns for the unique identifier (`unique_id`), timestamps (`ds`), target variable (`y`), and an exogenous variable (`exog`).

2. **Initialize Model**:
   - We initialize the TFT model by specifying parameters like `input_size` (number of past observations to consider), `h` (forecast horizon), `max_steps`, and `futr_exog_list` to include exogenous variables.

3. **Create NeuralForecast Instance**:
   - An instance of `NeuralForecast` is created with the TFT model. The `freq` parameter indicates the frequency of the data (daily in this case).

4. **Fit Model**:
   - The `fit` method is used to train the model on the dataset.

5. **Predict Future Values**:
   - The `predict` method is used to forecast future values. We then print the predictions to see the results.

This example demonstrates the power and flexibility of NeuralForecast in handling more complex forecasting tasks that include exogenous variables, providing more accurate and informative forecasts. Experiment with different parameters and models to see how they impact your forecasts and tailor them to your specific use cases!
