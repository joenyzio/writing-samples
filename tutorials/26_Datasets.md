## Challenge: Real-World Application

Now that we've explored various data repositories, it's time to put your knowledge to the test. This challenge will help you get hands-on experience with datasets, from accessing and processing them to utilizing them in your AI projects, while also making a positive impact on global challenges.

### Task Description

Our goal is to select a dataset related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and use it to develop a simple AI application. This exercise will guide you through the process of data exploration, preparation, and model training, providing practical insights into working with real-world data that contributes to global progress.

### Steps to Complete

1. **Select a Dataset**:
   - Choose a dataset from the United Nations SDG Global Database. For example, you could use data related to poverty, education, or climate action.

2. **Access and Load the Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset and load it into your preferred programming environment (e.g., Python, R).

   ```python
   import pandas as pd  # Import the pandas library for data manipulation

   # Example: Load an SDG dataset from a CSV file
   url = 'https://path/to/sdg_dataset.csv'  # URL of the dataset
   data = pd.read_csv(url)  # Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame
   ```

3. **Explore the Data**:
   - Perform an initial exploration to understand the dataset. Look at the structure, summary statistics, and any missing values.

   ```python
   # Display the first few rows of the dataset to get an overview
   print(data.head())

   # Display summary statistics for numerical columns to understand data distribution
   print(data.describe())

   # Check for missing values in the dataset
   print(data.isnull().sum())
   ```

4. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for model training. This might include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

   ```python
   # Example: Fill missing values in 'SomeFeature' with the mean value of the column
   data['SomeFeature'].fillna(data['SomeFeature'].mean(), inplace=True)

   # Encode categorical variables into numerical values using one-hot encoding
   data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['CategoryFeature'], drop_first=True)
   ```

5. **Train an AI Model**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets, then train a machine learning model using the prepared data.

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  # Import train_test_split to split data
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier  # Import RandomForestClassifier for model training
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score  # Import accuracy_score to evaluate model performance

   # Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y)
   X = data.drop('TargetFeature', axis=1)  # Drop the target column from the dataset
   y = data['TargetFeature']  # Define the target variable

   # Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

   # Instantiate the RandomForestClassifier with 100 trees
   model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

   # Train the model on the training data
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)

   # Make predictions on the testing data
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

6. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Assess the performance of your model using appropriate metrics.

   ```python
   # Calculate the accuracy of the model by comparing predicted and actual values
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
   print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy}')  # Print the accuracy of the model
   ```

7. **Document and Share Your Findings**:
   - Document your process, findings, and any insights gained from the data. Share your work through a report, blog post, or GitHub repository.

### Expected Outcome

By the end of this challenge, you will have a working AI model trained on a dataset that contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals. You will gain practical experience in data handling, preprocessing, and model evaluation, while also contributing to global efforts in solving critical issues.
