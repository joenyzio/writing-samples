## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Basic Machine Translation

Let’s start with a simple example of translating a sentence from English to German using a pre-trained model. We'll go through the steps to download the model, prepare the data, translate a sentence, and get the translation.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Download Model] --> B[Prepare Data];
    B --> C[Translate Sentence];
    C --> D[Get Translation];
```

1. **Download a pre-trained model**:

   First, we need to download a pre-trained machine translation model from English to German. Open your terminal and run the following commands to download and extract the model:

   ```bash
   wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fairseq/models/wmt19.en-de.joined-dict.single_model.tar.gz
   tar -xzvf wmt19.en-de.joined-dict.single_model.tar.gz
   ```

   This will download the model file and extract it, making it ready for use.

2. **Translate a sentence**:

   Next, we'll use the downloaded model to translate a sentence from English to German. The `fairseq-interactive` command allows for interactive translation. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   echo "Hello, how are you?" | fairseq-interactive data-bin/wmt19.en-de.joined-dict.single_model --path model.pt --beam 5 --source-lang en --target-lang de
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `echo "Hello, how are you?"`: This part sends the sentence to be translated.
   - `fairseq-interactive`: This command runs the translation interactively.
   - `data-bin/wmt19.en-de.joined-dict.single_model`: Specifies the path to the model data.
   - `--path model.pt`: Points to the pre-trained model file.
   - `--beam 5`: Sets the beam search width to 5, which helps improve translation quality by considering multiple possible translations.
   - `--source-lang en --target-lang de`: Defines the source and target languages, English and German, respectively.

Running this command will output the translation of "Hello, how are you?" into German. This simple example shows how easy it is to use FAIRseq for machine translation tasks with minimal setup. Ready to try more advanced tasks? Let's move on to the next example!

### Example 2: Advanced Summarization

Now, let's dive into a more advanced example where we summarize a piece of text using FAIRseq. This process involves preparing your dataset, training a new summarization model, and generating summaries.

1. **Prepare the dataset**:

   First, we need to preprocess our data to create the necessary files for training. This command will convert your raw data into a format that FAIRseq can use:

   ```bash
   fairseq-preprocess --source-lang src --target-lang tgt --trainpref train --validpref valid --testpref test --destdir data-bin
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `--source-lang src --target-lang tgt`: Specifies the source and target languages. For summarization, these could be the same.
   - `--trainpref train --validpref valid --testpref test`: Indicates the prefixes for the training, validation, and test datasets.
   - `--destdir data-bin`: Specifies the destination directory for the processed data.

2. **Train a new summarization model**:

   Next, we'll train a summarization model using the preprocessed data. This command configures and starts the training process:

   ```bash
   fairseq-train data-bin --arch transformer --task translation --criterion label_smoothed_cross_entropy --optimizer adam --lr 0.0005 --max-tokens 4096 --update-freq 16 --save-dir checkpoints
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `data-bin`: Specifies the directory containing the preprocessed data.
   - `--arch transformer`: Uses the transformer architecture for the model.
   - `--task translation`: Sets the task to translation, which is suitable for summarization tasks.
   - `--criterion label_smoothed_cross_entropy`: Uses label-smoothed cross-entropy as the loss function, which helps improve the quality of the generated summaries.
   - `--optimizer adam`: Chooses the Adam optimizer for training.
   - `--lr 0.0005`: Sets the learning rate for the optimizer.
   - `--max-tokens 4096`: Defines the maximum number of tokens in a batch.
   - `--update-freq 16`: Updates the model every 16 batches to stabilize training.
   - `--save-dir checkpoints`: Specifies the directory where model checkpoints will be saved.

3. **Generate summaries**:

   Finally, we use the trained model to generate summaries from the test data. This command will produce summaries for the given input text:

   ```bash
   fairseq-generate data-bin --path checkpoints/checkpoint_best.pt --beam 5 --batch-size 128 --remove-bpe
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `data-bin`: Specifies the directory containing the preprocessed data.
   - `--path checkpoints/checkpoint_best.pt`: Points to the best checkpoint of the trained model.
   - `--beam 5`: Sets the beam search width to 5, which helps in generating high-quality summaries.
   - `--batch-size 128`: Processes 128 sentences at a time for efficient generation.
   - `--remove-bpe`: Removes Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to produce readable text.

By following these steps, you can effectively use FAIRseq to perform advanced text summarization tasks, showcasing its power and versatility in handling complex sequence-to-sequence applications.
